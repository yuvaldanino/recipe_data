Step-by-Step Plan
1. Define Scope & Requirements
Goal: Collect general cooking tips (not just recipe steps) from reputable recipe websites.
Format: JSONL, with each line as {"prompt": "...", "response": "..."}.
Focus: General cooking tips, techniques, and advice (not specific recipes).
2. Select Target Websites
Websites: Use sites supported by recipe-scrapers such as:
Allrecipes
Food Network
BBC Good Food
Epicurious
Serious Eats
Simply Recipes
Rationale: These sites are reputable, have a wide range of tips, and are supported by the library.
3. Technology Stack
Python: Main scripting language.
recipe-scrapers: For extracting recipe data from supported sites.
requests: For fetching web pages.
BeautifulSoup: For additional HTML parsing if needed (e.g., to extract tips/notes not covered by recipe-scrapers).
json: For writing JSONL output.
pandas (optional): For data cleaning and deduplication.
tqdm (optional): For progress bars during scraping.
4. Data Extraction Workflow
A. Gather URLs
Option 1: Manually collect URLs of popular recipes from each site.
Option 2: Use site search or sitemap to programmatically gather URLs (if allowed).
B. Scrape Recipes
Use recipe-scrapers to extract:
Tips/Notes/Advice: Look for fields like notes(), description(), or custom HTML sections (e.g., “Tips”, “Chef’s Notes”).
FAQs: Some sites have FAQ sections with Q&A format.
C. Extract & Generate Q&A Pairs
For each tip/advice:
Prompt: Generate a natural question (e.g., “How do I keep chicken moist while cooking?”).
Response: Use the tip/advice as the answer.
If the tip is not in Q&A format, paraphrase as needed.
D. Data Cleaning
Remove duplicates.
Ensure clarity and conciseness.
Validate JSONL formatting.
E. Save Data
Write each Q&A pair as a line in a .jsonl file.
5. Quality Assurance
Manual Review: Spot-check a sample for quality and accuracy.
Validation Script: Ensure all lines are valid JSON and fields are present.
6. (Optional) Data Augmentation
Paraphrase questions and answers for diversity.
Add manually curated tips for important topics.
7. Documentation
Document the process, sources, and any manual interventions for reproducibility.
Summary Table
| Step | Technology/Library | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| URL Gathering | Python, requests, manual | Collect recipe URLs |
| Scraping | recipe-scrapers, requests | Extract recipe data and tips |
| HTML Parsing | BeautifulSoup | Extract tips not covered by scrapers |
| Data Processing | Python, pandas (optional) | Clean, deduplicate, format data |
| Output | json | Write JSONL file |
| QA | Python, manual review | Validate and spot-check data |
Next Steps
Confirm the list of target websites.
Decide on manual vs. automated URL collection.
Start coding the scraping and extraction pipeline.
